# mcai-materials-site

Governed materials showcase powered by **Moral Clarity AI**.

This repository hosts **static content and UI surfaces** that invoke **Solace** as a *bounded, refusal-first technical explainer* for sustainable materials and risk-reduction technologies.

**No AI logic, prompts, memory systems, or governance rules live in this repository.**

---

## Purpose

This site exists to demonstrate how governed AI can safely and credibly explain real-world technologies without overclaiming, speculation, or drift.

Solace is exposed here strictly as a **context-locked material steward**, answering questions only from:
- Published page content
- Approved explanatory language
- Explicit non-claims and refusal boundaries

The authoritative AI system lives elsewhere.

---

## What This Repository Contains

- Static product and concept pages (e.g. BioSyntar™, PolyVerdia™)
- UI components for invoking Solace
- Content files used as bounded context
- Disclosure and limitation language
- Client-side API calls to Moral Clarity AI

---

## What This Repository Does NOT Contain

- ❌ Model prompts
- ❌ Memory systems
- ❌ Tooling or agent logic
- ❌ Governance or refusal rules
- ❌ Model selection or routing logic
- ❌ Training data or inference pipelines

All AI authority remains **upstream** in Moral Clarity AI.

---

## Architectural Boundary

This repository **requests explanations**.  
Moral Clarity AI **decides what can be said**.

All Solace responses are:
- Context-verified
- Refusal-first
- Non-speculative
- Audit-compatible

If a question exceeds allowed scope, Solace will decline and redirect to appropriate human channels.

---

## Intentional Design Choices

- Public repository for transparency and auditability
- Explicit separation between content surfaces and AI authority
- Calm, visible refusal behavior as a feature — not a failure
- No lead capture or sales logic inside AI interactions

---

## Related Systems

- **Moral Clarity AI** — canonical AI governance, routing, and refusal engine
- **Solace** — governed explainer operating under strict authority limits

---

## Status

Early-stage, intentionally constrained.

This repository prioritizes **clarity, restraint, and credibility** over velocity or feature breadth.
